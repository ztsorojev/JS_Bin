# Web Code Compiler

I rebuilt the JS Bin website. You can find my version [here](https://ztsorojev.github.io/JS_Bin/).

**Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery <br />

![Alt text](https://github.com/ztsorojev/JS_Bin/blob/master/jsbin2.JPG)

This website allows you to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript code and compile it through your web browser to see the result.

## How it works

It works in the following way:
1) Toggle the top menu to make appear the sections that you want: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Result. 
Each section vertically divides the screen in a uniform way.
2) Write the appropriate code in each section.
3) Press the "Run" button to see the result of all your code put together.
