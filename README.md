# Web Code Compiler

I built a copy of the JS Bin website (https://jsbin.com).

This website allows you to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript code and compile it through your web browser to see the result.

## How it works

It works in the following way:
1) Toggle the top menu to make appear the sections that you want: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Result. 
Each section vertically divides the screen in a uniform way.
2) Write the appropriate code in each section.
3) Press the "Run" button to see the result of all your code put together.
